Before doing an uprev of lxc I wanted to do some housekeeping on the
current version, the result of some runtime testing with sysvinit and
systemd along with some feedback from users. There were some
inconsistencies between the packaging and handling of the two init
systems which these change address, making the runtime experience
match more closely. This also addresses some of the bugs we have
recieved due to the -setup package which had (d)evolved from its
initial intent. There is nothing groundbreaking here, and the end
result should just be that there is less confusion when one wants to
get lxc up and running in an image. These changes were tested
thoroughly with 'cgroup-lite', 'lxc' and optionally 'lxc-networking'
packages added to core-image-minimal when either sysvinit or systemd
is in use.
